Tutorial: How to use R to analyse data from FEA using the intervals’ method

We have developed a new method, named the intervals’ method, to analyse data from finite element models in a comparative multivariate framework.The intervals’ method consists of generating a set of variables, each one defined by an interval of stress values. Each variable is expressed as a percentage of the area of the model occupied by those stress values. Afterwards these newly generated variables can be analysed using multivariate methods.

In the provided example, four armadillo mandibles are studied. They correspond to some of the individuals that were analysed in the paper where the Intervals’ method was introduced for the first time, showing that the proposed method is useful to distinguish and characterise biomechanical differences related to diet/ecomorphology:

Ca. unicinctus: Specialist insectivore

Ch. truncatus: Generalist insectivore-fossorial

D. novemcinctus: Generalist insectivore

Ca. tatouay: Generalist insectivore-fossorial
